# Challenge 02

This is the first step of four to the Rocketseat's Bootcamp final challenge. For the final challenge we will build a complete application (backend, frontend and mobile) for a generic shipping company, that will be called here as FastFeet.
At this step we will begin to build the backend with the following features:

## Features
